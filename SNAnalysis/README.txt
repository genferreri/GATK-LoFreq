This program will evaluate whether mutations are synonymous or not synonymous.
This runs locally.
Takes as input parsed vcf files using 1_VCFvariant.sh. Hence, input will be as *_AF.Cov-ALT.vcf.txt
SNPdat_Parse.sh has to be execute from the working directory.
For the evaluation of WF10 whole genome, the program needs WF10ref.gtf.txt, WF10_curated_varpatch.fa, and the SNPdat dependency.
